This project is an online Children's clothing store that has been implemented by order of one of my relatives. ButÙˆ it was not completed due to their lack of follow-up.
I used reactjs and bootstrap(reactstrap library) for implementing it.
You can see video of website demo from [here](https://www.aparat.com/v/bJSPx).

# Project features:
in this website, products must show on main page and any of them has buttons attached to them for opening detail page of it(product info like size,color,price and etc) and buy.
by clicking on buy button, sailer info(name , phone, social links,...) will show on a modal to contact him.
also we implement a dashboard with a simple login form to adding, removing ,show all ,... of products. therefore, a form for entering product info with **image upload**(to server) implemented in it.
we doesn't implement cart(according to customer order).
